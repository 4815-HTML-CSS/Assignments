			<p>
				Tabletop games or tabletops are games that are normally played on a
				table or other flat surface, such as board games, card games, dice
				games, miniature wargames, or tile-based games.
			</p>

			<p>
				Games like chess and draughts are examples of games belonging to the
				board game category. Other games, however, use various attributes and
				cannot be classified unambiguously (e.g. Monopoly utilises a board as
				well as dice and cards).
			</p>

			<p>You will find some examples of some table top games below.</p>
